### [Post 1: What make a succesful Gen-Z founder: A case study ](/osaka-me-brain-agi/posts/one)

Okay, to be honest, I'm not sure when [David Park](https://twitter.com/Davidjpark96?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) was born % \_ %, but it makes for an interesting title. [Jenni.ai](https://jenni.ai/) is... well, look it up yourself to boost its SEO ~ o ~ but if you do any sort of research, you're missing out if you don't use it. I've been following David on Twitter for the last year or so (yes, I still hate TechTwt, but monkey brain go brr), and he's been building Jenni.ai in public for the last 4 years or so. I had this idea of going through his tweets (over 2400 at this moment) and training a GPT model to see what I can find. The only reason I'm doing this is that why the heck not? I think he's a cool guy with a cool product, and maybe I'll learn something from twt (for once ! - !)
