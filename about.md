### About me

My name is Simar Malhotra, and I am currently a rising junior majoring in Computer Science with a (potential) minor in Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University. As of Summer 2024, I'm interning at India's premier university, IIT Delhi, as a machine learning intern under Dr. Manan Suri. Previously, I have completed an internship as a Software Engineer at Drake Software Services, have been an undergraduate research assistant under Dr. Wen-Li Wang, and served as a Teaching Assistant for PHY 212 under Dr. Chuck Yeung

## The biggest + about CS for me is the potential ability to do something with just a few people and lots of compute. I am always and always looking for things to collaborate with other people on. If you have any such ideas, please reach out.
