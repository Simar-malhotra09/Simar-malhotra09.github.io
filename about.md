### About me

My name is Simar Malhotra, and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science with a (potential)minor in Mathematics @ Pennsylvania State University. As of Spring 2024, I have completed an internship as a Software Engineer @ Drake Software Services. Currently, I am engaged in undergraduate research under Dr. Wen-Li Wang and serve as a Teaching Assistant for Phy 212.

## The biggest + about CS for me is the potential ability to do something with just a few people and lots of compute. I am always and always looking for things to collaborate with other people on. If you have any such ideas, please reach out.

I'm currently working on a Discord bot, more or less, on making it a planner for primarily school. It takes in data I've sourced from the Canvas API and can answer simple questions like 'List all homework assignments that are due this weekend.' I would like to add more features to encompass outside school functions as well.
