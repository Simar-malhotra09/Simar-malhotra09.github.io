### Neutrons

We know what neutrons are: subatomic particles with two down quarks and one up quark, mass lighter than a proton, and neutral electric charge. This doesn't help me a lot. What would happen is neutrons didn't exist, is a more interesting question, in hope for a more intutive understanding. Well, first of all, we, and every atom in this universe would explode, and disintegrate into Hydrogen(1p, 1e). This is because the nucleus would not be stable anymore.
