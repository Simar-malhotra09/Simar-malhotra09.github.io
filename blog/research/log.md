I honestly did not realize research would be this hard. What I'm currently focusing on is sentiment analysis, although I did have a few more interesting ideas in mind. My approach has been naive. I'm looking at datasets that have low best-model accuracy. For example, SST-5 (59.80%) and Yelp fine-grained classification (49.0%). I am trying to replicate and improve those. Although research on NLP/sentiment analysis has been going on for a long time, I wonder what I can really do. What I would like to do is potentially shift the focus from purely academic value to some real-world value. I could work on the IMDb dataset, and for the purpose of proposing a better approach/model, that's cool. But who really cares if I have XYZ accuracy on this dataset of movie reviews? How can sentiment analysis be used in practical applications is what I want to explore a bit. Although that might end up being a pipe dream if I don't focus.

Also, about the datasets, I want to round up the top 10 or so and see what they are lacking. I have an intuition that a lot of these datasets, especially text, tend to be really similar. I admit I don't really know what I'm talking about, though.
