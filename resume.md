#### Education

I go to Penn State and I have never been to a game ( two statements that shouldn't go in the same sentence or so I was told T^T ).
The reason I went to PSU is pretty simple, no other college really accepted me. Which I still think is pretty weird considering I had a good SAT and whatnot.
