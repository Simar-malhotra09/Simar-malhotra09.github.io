    Okay, to be fair, this isn't really too whack. Although, maybe it was just the natural lighting and the white backdrop. I just realized I actually prefer strong contrasting colors. Although, I think investing in some accessories won't harm me in the long run; the issue is I have no clue where to start. The last time I did, I ended up looking like 2013 King Batch, and not in a good way (if there ever was one x o x).
