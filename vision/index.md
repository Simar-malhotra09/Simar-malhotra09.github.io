### [ Healthkit + LLM ](/vision/one)

So I like to work out, and I've been pretty serious about it (even if it doesn't look so T ^ Tâ€”shut up). Arguably, the most significant cog in the wheel of gains is nutrition, which I'm decently knowledgeable about (on a 389-day macro tracking streak). But the problem is, it is extremely hard to gauge your nutritional needs such as maintenance calories and so on. A simple search would lead you to a macro calc, which is a good start but can be easily off by close to 300-400 in some cases. And as Sam would say, that is not ideal. The idea is simple: Use activity and health data from the Heathkit API to track and adapt nutrition on the fly to close down the number of variables that are unknown. This is the base case; I have a feeling that there are tons and tons more we can do with this.
